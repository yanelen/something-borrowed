The app is visible at: http://still-sea-2278.herokuapp.com


### Overview

This is a single page app where users can post items they are willing to lend to other users for a specified amount of time.

The app is preceded by signing up or logging in. It will then take the user to a page with 4 lists: Available items, My borrowed items, My lent items and My listed items.

'Available items' lists all items available. There is a 'Borrow me' button where the user can borrow an item.

'My borrowed items' lists all items the user is currently borrowing. There's a 'Return me' button where the user can return an item. The user can write a message to the lender under the item.

'My lent items' lists all items the user is currently lending out. The user can write a message to the borrower under the item.

'My listed items' lists all the user's available items. There are two buttons: Edit and Delete

The user can create a new post by clicking '+ Add an item'. A form then comes up with 'item name' and 'item description' fields, as well as a map where the user can pin the general location of the item.

There's a search button where the user can search by item for things they would like to borrow.
